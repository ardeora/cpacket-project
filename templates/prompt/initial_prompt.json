This attack type exhibits distinct patterns in header structures, flag distributions, and timing characteristics.\n\nKEY OSYN ATTACK CHARACTERISTICS:\n1. RST Flag Manipulation: High percentage of RST flags (mean: 38%, range: 0-100%)\n2. SYN Flag Patterns: Moderate SYN flag usage (mean: 50%, range: 0-100%) \n3. Header Structure: TCP headers typically 20-40 bytes (constrained by protocol)\n4. Connection Disruption: Variable timing patterns from connection manipulation\n5. Window Size Manipulation: Can include zero window sizes to disrupt connections\n\nFEATURE CONSTRAINTS AND RELATIONSHIPS:\n\nHeader Features (bytes):\n- total_header_bytes: 20-380 (most commonly 20-40, mean: 41.87)\n- min_header_bytes: 20-40 (TCP minimum header size constraints)\n- max_header_bytes: 20-40 (typical TCP header range)\n- fwd_median_header_bytes: 0-40 (4.5% can be 0, mean: 23.18)\n- fwd_mode_header_bytes: 0-40 (similar to median)\n- fwd_mean_header_bytes: derived from other header metrics\n\nFlag Features (percentages 0.0-1.0):\n- rst_flag_percentage_in_total: 0.0-1.0 (mean: 0.38, 40% are zero) [CRITICAL]\n- fwd_syn_flag_percentage_in_total: 0.0-1.0 (mean: 0.50, 29% are zero) [CRITICAL]\n- syn_flag_percentage_in_total: 0.0-1.0 (overall SYN percentage)\n- bwd_rst_flag_percentage_in_total: 0.0-1.0 (mean: 0.22)\n- fwd_psh_flag_percentage_in_fwd_packets: 0.0-1.0\n- fwd_syn_flag_percentage_in_fwd_packets: 0.0-1.0\n- bwd_psh_flag_percentage_in_bwd_packets: 0.0-1.0\n\nFlag Counts (integers):\n- rst_flag_counts: non-negative integers (related to rst percentages)\n- bwd_rst_flag_counts: non-negative integers\n\nTiming Features (microseconds):\n- packets_IAT_median: 0 to 1,703,001,600 (mean: 962,858,995)\n- packets_IAT_mode: 0 to 1,703,001,600 (mean: 962,858,995)\n- packets_IAT_mean: 0 to 1,703,001,600 (derived from IAT distribution)\n- fwd_packets_IAT_mean: 0 to 1,703,001,600 (mean: 1,538,774,739)\n- fwd_packets_IAT_max: 0 to 1,703,001,600\n- fwd_packets_IAT_min: 0 to 1,703,001,600\n- fwd_packets_IAT_total: 0 to 1,703,001,600\n- fwd_packets_IAT_median: 0 to 1,703,001,600\n- fwd_packets_IAT_mode: 0 to 1,703,001,600\n- packet_IAT_max: 0 to 1,703,001,600\n- packet_IAT_min: 0 to 1,703,001,600\n- packet_IAT_total: 0 to 1,703,001,600\n- bwd_packets_IAT_total: 0 to 1,703,001,600\n- bwd_packets_IAT_mode: 0 to 1,703,001,600\n\nRate Features:\n- packets_rate: positive float (packets per second)\n- bwd_packets_rate: positive float\n- fwd_packets_rate: positive float\n\nWindow Features:\n- fwd_init_win_bytes: 0-65,535 (TCP window size, 11% are zero, mean: 18,266)\n- bwd_init_win_bytes: 0-65,535 (similar pattern)\n\nFixed Labels:\n- label: \"Attack\"\n- activity: \"Attack-TCP-Flag-OSYN\"\n\nCRITICAL RELATIONSHIPS:\n1. Header bytes must follow TCP protocol constraints (min \u2264 median \u2264 max)\n2. Forward header metrics should be consistent (median \u2248 mode when not zero)\n3. RST and SYN flag percentages are key OSYN attack indicators\n4. Timing features often have zeros (indicating instant responses)\n5. Rate features are mathematically related to timing features\n6. Flag counts should align with flag percentages\n\nGENERATION RULES:\n1. Maintain realistic TCP header size relationships\n2. Ensure flag percentages reflect OSYN attack behavior (high RST, moderate SYN)\n3. Include realistic timing variance (can be zero or very large)\n4. Keep window sizes within TCP protocol limits\n5. Ensure mathematical consistency between related features\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nGenerate exactly one row of data in the following XML format:\n\n<network_flow>\n  <meta label=\"Attack\" activity=\"Attack-TCP-Flag-OSYN\"/>\n  <headers>\n    <overall\n      total_bytes=\"total_header_bytes\" \n      max_bytes=\"max_header_bytes\"\n      min_bytes=\"min_header_bytes\"\n      mean_bytes=\"mean_header_bytes\"\n      median_bytes=\"median_header_bytes\"\n      mode_bytes=\"mode_header_bytes\"\n    />\n    <forward \n      total_bytes=\"fwd_total_header_bytes\"\n      median_bytes=\"fwd_median_header_bytes\"\n      mode_bytes=\"fwd_mode_header_bytes\"\n      max_bytes=\"fwd_max_header_bytes\"\n      min_bytes=\"fwd_min_header_bytes\"\n      mean_bytes=\"fwd_mean_header_bytes\"\n    />\n  </headers>\n  <flags>\n    <overall \n      total_rst_flag_percentage=\"rst_flag_percentage_in_total\"\n      total_syn_flag_percentage=\"syn_flag_percentage_in_total\"\n      rst_flag_counts=\"rst_flag_counts\"\n    />\n    <forward \n      total_syn_flag_percentage=\"fwd_syn_flag_percentage_in_total\"\n      psh_flag_percentage_in_forward_packets=\"fwd_psh_flag_percentage_in_fwd_packets\"\n      syn_flag_percentage_in_forward_packets=\"fwd_syn_flag_percentage_in_fwd_packets\"\n    />\n    <backward \n      total_rst_flag_percentage=\"bwd_rst_flag_percentage_in_total\"\n      psh_flag_percentage_in_backward_packets=\"bwd_psh_flag_percentage_in_bwd_packets\"\n      rst_flag_counts=\"bwd_rst_flag_counts\"\n    />\n  </flags>\n  <inter_arrival_timing>\n    <overall \n      median_packets=\"packets_IAT_median\"\n      mode_packets=\"packets_IAT_mode\"\n      mean_packets=\"packets_IAT_mean\"\n      max_packets=\"packet_IAT_max\"\n      min_packets=\"packet_IAT_min\"\n      total_packets=\"packet_IAT_total\"\n    />\n    <forward \n      total_packets=\"fwd_packets_IAT_total\"\n      mean_packets=\"fwd_packets_IAT_mean\"\n      max_packets=\"fwd_packets_IAT_max\"\n      min_packets=\"fwd_packets_IAT_min\"\n      median_packets=\"fwd_packets_IAT_median\"\n      mode_packets=\"fwd_packets_IAT_mode\"\n    />\n    <backward   \n      total_packets=\"bwd_packets_IAT_total\"\n      mode_bytes=\"bwd_packets_IAT_mode\"      \n    />\n  </inter_arrival_timing>\n  <window>\n    <forward \n      init_bytes=\"fwd_init_win_bytes\"\n    />\n    <backward \n      init_bytes=\"bwd_init_win_bytes\"\n    />\n  </window>\n  <rates \n    packets=\"packets_rate\"\n    backward_packets=\"bwd_packets_rate\"\n    forward_packets=\"fwd_packets_rate\"\n  />\n</network_flow>"
