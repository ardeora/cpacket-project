# Complete Beginner's Guide to LLaMA 3.1 LoRA Fine-tuning

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for fine-tuning LLaMA 3.1 using LoRA! This tutorial is designed for beginners who want to understand every step of the process. We'll explain concepts, provide examples, and guide you through practical implementations.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll understand:

- What LoRA fine-tuning is and why it's useful
- How to prepare data for training
- How to configure and run training
- How to use your fine-tuned model
- How to troubleshoot common issues

## üìö What is LoRA Fine-tuning?

### Traditional Fine-tuning vs LoRA

**Traditional Fine-tuning:**

- Updates ALL parameters of the model (billions of them!)
- Requires massive GPU memory (80GB+ for large models)
- Takes a very long time
- Creates a completely new model file

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):**

- Only adds small "adapter" layers (millions of parameters)
- Works with much less GPU memory (16GB can work!)
- Trains much faster
- Creates small adapter files that work with the original model

### Real-World Analogy

Think of the base model as a brilliant professor who knows everything about language. LoRA is like giving the professor a specialized notebook for a specific subject. The professor's core knowledge stays the same, but they now have specialized notes for your particular domain.

## üöÄ Quick Start (5-Minute Version)

If you want to see it working quickly:

```bash
# 1. Install requirements
pip install transformers datasets torch peft bitsandbytes accelerate

# 2. Run the data preparation example
python llama_lora_data_prep.py

# 3. Run training (will show examples even without GPU)
python llama_lora_training.py
```

## üìÅ Files in This Repository

- **`llama_lora_data_prep.py`**: Smart script that converts your data into the format LLaMA understands
- **`llama_lora_training.py`**: Handles the actual training process with optimizations
- **`LLAMA_LORA_README.md`**: This comprehensive guide you're reading

## üõ†Ô∏è Complete Setup Guide

### Step 1: Environment Setup

#### Option A: Using Conda (Recommended for Beginners)

```bash
# Create a new environment
conda create -n llama-lora python=3.10
conda activate llama-lora

# Install PyTorch with CUDA support (check your CUDA version)
conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia

# Install other requirements
pip install transformers datasets peft bitsandbytes accelerate trl pandas numpy tqdm
```

#### Option B: Using pip

```bash
# Install requirements
pip install transformers datasets torch peft bitsandbytes accelerate trl pandas numpy tqdm
```

### Step 2: Hardware Check

**Check your GPU:**

```python
import torch
print(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
print(f"GPU count: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print(f"GPU name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
    print(f"GPU memory: {torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory / 1024**3:.1f} GB")
```

**Memory Requirements:**

- **16GB GPU**: Can train with 4-bit quantization + small batch sizes
- **24GB GPU**: Comfortable training with good performance
- **40GB+ GPU**: Can use larger batch sizes and higher precision
- **No GPU**: You can still run the data preparation and see examples!

### Step 3: HuggingFace Setup

```bash
# Install HuggingFace CLI
pip install huggingface_hub

# Login to HuggingFace (needed for LLaMA access)
huggingface-cli login
```

You'll need to:

1. Create a HuggingFace account at https://huggingface.co
2. Accept the LLaMA 3.1 license at https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
3. Use your access token when prompted

## üìä Understanding Data Preparation

### Why Data Format Matters

LLaMA 3.1 expects conversations in a specific format. Think of it like teaching someone a new language - you need to show them examples in the right structure.

### The Three Main Data Types

#### 1. üìù Instruction-Following (Most Common)

**When to use:** Teaching the model to follow specific instructions
**Example use cases:** "Summarize this text", "Translate to Spanish", "Explain this concept"

```json
{
  "instruction": "Explain photosynthesis in simple terms",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Photosynthesis is how plants make food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. They take in sunlight through their leaves, absorb water through their roots, and breathe in carbon dioxide from the air. Then they combine these to make sugar (their food) and release oxygen that we breathe!"
}
```

**What happens behind the scenes:**
The script converts this to LLaMA's chat format:

```
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

You are a helpful assistant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Explain photosynthesis in simple terms<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Photosynthesis is how plants make food using sunlight...
```

#### 2. üí¨ Conversational

**When to use:** Training chatbots or multi-turn conversations
**Example use cases:** Customer service bots, tutoring assistants

```json
{
  "conversations": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "I'm struggling with calculus" },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I'd be happy to help! What specific topic in calculus are you finding difficult?"
    },
    { "role": "user", "content": "Derivatives are confusing me" },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Derivatives measure how fast something changes. Think of it like the speedometer in your car - it tells you how fast your position is changing at any moment. Would you like me to walk through the basic rules?"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. ‚ùì Question-Answer

**When to use:** Building knowledge bases or FAQ systems
**Example use cases:** Domain-specific QA, educational content

```json
{
  "question": "What causes seasons on Earth?",
  "context": "Earth orbits the Sun once per year and rotates on its axis once per day. Earth's axis is tilted at about 23.5 degrees.",
  "answer": "Seasons are caused by Earth's tilted axis. As Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of Earth are tilted toward or away from the Sun at different times of the year, causing variations in sunlight and temperature."
}
```

### üéØ Practical Data Preparation Example

Let's create a simple dataset for teaching cooking:

```python
# Create cooking_data.json
cooking_data = [
    {
        "instruction": "How do I make scrambled eggs?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "To make scrambled eggs: 1) Crack 2-3 eggs into a bowl, 2) Add a splash of milk and whisk, 3) Heat butter in a pan over medium-low heat, 4) Pour in eggs and gently stir continuously, 5) Remove from heat while slightly wet (they'll continue cooking). Season with salt and pepper!"
    },
    {
        "instruction": "What's the secret to fluffy pancakes?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "The secret to fluffy pancakes is: 1) Don't overmix the batter (lumps are okay!), 2) Let the batter rest for 5 minutes, 3) Use buttermilk for extra fluff, 4) Cook on medium heat, not high, 5) Flip only once when bubbles form and edges look set."
    }
]

# Save to file
import json
with open('cooking_data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(cooking_data, f, indent=2)
```

### üîß Running Data Preparation

```python
from llama_lora_data_prep import LlamaDataPreparator

# Initialize the preparator
preparator = LlamaDataPreparator()

# Load your custom data
dataset = preparator.load_custom_dataset("cooking_data.json", data_type="instruction")

# The dataset is now ready for training!
print(f"Prepared {len(dataset)} training examples")
```

## üß† Understanding LoRA Parameters (The Key to Success)

LoRA has several parameters that control how the training works. Understanding these is crucial for success!

### üéöÔ∏è The Most Important Parameters

#### 1. **Rank (r)** - The Adaptation Capacity

Think of rank as "how much the model can change":

- **r=8**: Light touch-up (like adjusting brightness on a photo)
  - Use for: Similar tasks to what the model already knows
  - Example: Teaching medical LLaMA to be slightly more formal
- **r=16**: Balanced adaptation (like learning a new skill)
  - Use for: Most general fine-tuning tasks
  - Example: Teaching a general model to be a coding assistant
- **r=32-64**: Heavy modification (like learning a new language)
  - Use for: Very different domains or specialized tasks
  - Example: Teaching a general model to write legal documents

```python
# In your training code:
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,  # Start with 16 for most tasks
    # ... other parameters
)
```

#### 2. **Alpha (lora_alpha)** - The Learning Strength

This controls how much the LoRA adapters influence the model:

- **Rule of thumb**: Set alpha = 2 √ó rank
- **r=16 ‚Üí alpha=32** (most common)
- **Higher alpha**: Stronger adaptation, but risk of overfitting
- **Lower alpha**: Gentler adaptation, might underfit

#### 3. **Dropout (lora_dropout)** - Preventing Overfitting

- **0.05-0.1**: Good range for most tasks
- **Higher dropout**: Prevents overfitting with small datasets
- **Lower dropout**: Use with larger, diverse datasets

### üéØ Parameter Selection Guide

**For beginners, start with these proven combinations:**

```python
# Conservative (safe for small datasets)
r=8, alpha=16, dropout=0.1

# Balanced (works for most tasks)
r=16, alpha=32, dropout=0.05

# Aggressive (for very different domains)
r=32, alpha=64, dropout=0.1
```

### üèãÔ∏è Complete Training Tutorial

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Training Script

Create `my_training.py`:

```python
from llama_lora_training import LlamaLoRATrainer
from llama_lora_data_prep import LlamaDataPreparator
import json

# Step 1: Prepare your data
cooking_data = [
    {
        "instruction": "How do I make perfect rice?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "For perfect rice: 1) Rinse rice until water runs clear, 2) Use 1:1.5 ratio (rice:water), 3) Bring to boil, then simmer covered for 18 minutes, 4) Let rest 5 minutes off heat, 5) Fluff with fork. Never lift the lid during cooking!"
    },
    # Add more examples here...
]

# Save data
with open('my_cooking_data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(cooking_data, f, indent=2)

# Step 2: Prepare dataset
preparator = LlamaDataPreparator()
dataset = preparator.load_custom_dataset("my_cooking_data.json", "instruction")
preparator.save_dataset(dataset, "my_prepared_dataset")

# Step 3: Train the model
trainer = LlamaLoRATrainer("meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct")

# Setup with memory optimization
trainer.setup_model_and_tokenizer(use_4bit=True)

# Start training with beginner-friendly settings
trainer.train(
    dataset_path="my_prepared_dataset",
    output_dir="my_cooking_assistant",

    # Training parameters
    num_train_epochs=2,           # Don't overtrain
    per_device_train_batch_size=1, # Start small
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4, # Effective batch size = 4
    learning_rate=2e-4,           # Standard rate

    # Save frequently to avoid losing progress
    save_steps=50,
    logging_steps=10,
)

print("Training complete! Your model is saved in 'my_cooking_assistant'")
```

#### Step 2: Monitor Your Training

During training, watch for these signs:

**‚úÖ Good Training:**

```
Step 10: Loss = 2.1
Step 20: Loss = 1.8
Step 30: Loss = 1.6
```

Loss decreases steadily

**‚ùå Overfitting:**

```
Step 10: Loss = 2.1
Step 20: Loss = 0.5
Step 30: Loss = 0.1
```

Loss drops too quickly

**‚ùå Underfitting:**

```
Step 10: Loss = 2.1
Step 20: Loss = 2.0
Step 30: Loss = 2.0
```

Loss barely changes

#### Step 3: Test Your Model

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from peft import PeftModel

# Load your fine-tuned model
base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto"
)

model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "my_cooking_assistant")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct")

# Test it!
def ask_cooking_question(question):
    prompt = f"<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a helpful cooking assistant.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\n{question}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n"

    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=200, temperature=0.7)
    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

    # Extract just the assistant's response
    return response.split("<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>")[-1].strip()

# Try it out!
answer = ask_cooking_question("How do I know when pasta is done?")
print(answer)
```

## üé® Real-World Examples and Use Cases

### Example 1: Customer Service Bot

**Goal**: Train a model to handle customer support for an online store

**Data format**:

```json
[
  {
    "instruction": "A customer wants to return a product",
    "input": "I bought this shirt last week but it doesn't fit. Can I return it?",
    "output": "I'd be happy to help you with your return! Since you purchased the shirt within our 30-day return window, you're eligible for a full refund. Here's what you need to do: 1) Go to your order history and click 'Return Item', 2) Print the prepaid return label, 3) Package the item in its original condition, 4) Drop it off at any UPS location. Your refund will be processed within 3-5 business days after we receive it. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
  }
]
```

**Training settings**:

```python
# Customer service needs to be accurate and helpful
r=16,           # Moderate adaptation
alpha=32,       # Standard scaling
dropout=0.05,   # Low dropout for consistency
learning_rate=1e-4,  # Conservative learning rate
num_epochs=3    # More epochs for better learning
```

### Example 2: Code Documentation Assistant

**Goal**: Generate documentation for Python functions

**Data format**:

````json
[
  {
    "instruction": "Write documentation for this Python function",
    "input": "def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compound_frequency):\n    return principal * (1 + rate/compound_frequency) ** (compound_frequency * time)",
    "output": "```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compound_frequency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest on an investment.\n    \n    Args:\n        principal (float): Initial investment amount\n        rate (float): Annual interest rate (as decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5%)\n        time (float): Investment period in years\n        compound_frequency (int): Number of times interest compounds per year\n    \n    Returns:\n        float: Final amount after compound interest\n    \n    Example:\n        >>> calculate_compound_interest(1000, 0.05, 2, 4)\n        1103.8128906250003\n    \"\"\"\n    return principal * (1 + rate/compound_frequency) ** (compound_frequency * time)\n```"
  }
]
````

### Example 3: Language Learning Tutor

**Conversational format for interactive learning**:

```json
[
  {
    "conversations": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "How do I say 'good morning' in Spanish?" },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "In Spanish, 'good morning' is 'Buenos d√≠as' (BWAY-nohs DEE-ahs). The 'Buenos' means 'good' and 'd√≠as' means 'days'. Try saying it out loud!"
      },
      { "role": "user", "content": "Buenos d√≠as! How about 'good evening'?" },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "¬°Excelente! Your pronunciation sounds great! 'Good evening' is 'Buenas noches' (BWAY-nahs NOH-chehs). Notice how 'Buenos' changes to 'Buenas' because 'noches' (nights) is feminine in Spanish."
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## üîß Memory Optimization and Hardware Tips

### Understanding GPU Memory Usage

**What uses memory during training:**

1. **Model weights**: The biggest chunk (8B model ‚âà 16GB in fp16)
2. **Optimizer states**: Additional memory for gradients
3. **Activations**: Temporary values during computation
4. **Batch data**: Your training examples

### üí° Memory Optimization Techniques

#### 1. 4-bit Quantization (Most Important!)

```python
# This can reduce memory usage by 50-75%!
trainer.setup_model_and_tokenizer(use_4bit=True)
```

**How it works**: Instead of storing numbers with 16 bits of precision, we use only 4 bits. It's like compressing an image - you lose some quality but save tons of space.

#### 2. Gradient Accumulation (Simulate Larger Batches)

```python
# Instead of processing 8 examples at once (might not fit)
per_device_train_batch_size = 8

# Process 1 example at a time, but accumulate gradients from 8
per_device_train_batch_size = 1
gradient_accumulation_steps = 8
# Effective batch size is still 8!
```

#### 3. Gradient Checkpointing

```python
# Trade computation time for memory
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    gradient_checkpointing=True,  # Saves memory at cost of speed
    # ... other args
)
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Hardware-Specific Recommendations

#### 16GB GPU (RTX 4090, A4000)

```python
# Conservative settings that should work
per_device_train_batch_size = 1
gradient_accumulation_steps = 8
max_seq_length = 1024  # Shorter sequences
use_4bit = True
gradient_checkpointing = True
```

#### 24GB GPU (RTX 4090 Ti, A5000)

```python
# More comfortable settings
per_device_train_batch_size = 2
gradient_accumulation_steps = 4
max_seq_length = 2048
use_4bit = True
gradient_checkpointing = False  # Can afford more speed
```

#### 40GB+ GPU (A100, H100)

```python
# High-performance settings
per_device_train_batch_size = 4
gradient_accumulation_steps = 2
max_seq_length = 4096
use_4bit = False  # Can use full precision
gradient_checkpointing = False
```

#### No GPU (CPU Only)

You can still:

- Run data preparation scripts
- Test model loading and formatting
- Prepare everything for cloud training
- Use the scripts as learning tools

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem 1: "CUDA Out of Memory"

**Symptoms:**

```
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.00 GiB
```

**Solutions (try in order):**

```python
# 1. Reduce batch size
per_device_train_batch_size = 1

# 2. Increase gradient accumulation
gradient_accumulation_steps = 8

# 3. Enable 4-bit quantization
use_4bit = True

# 4. Enable gradient checkpointing
gradient_checkpointing = True

# 5. Reduce sequence length
max_seq_length = 1024

# 6. Clear GPU memory and restart
import torch
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

### Problem 2: Training is Very Slow

**Symptoms:**

- Takes hours for a few steps
- GPU utilization is low

**Solutions:**

```python
# 1. Disable gradient checkpointing if memory allows
gradient_checkpointing = False

# 2. Increase batch size if memory allows
per_device_train_batch_size = 2

# 3. Use mixed precision
bf16 = True  # or fp16 = True

# 4. Optimize data loading
dataloader_num_workers = 4
dataloader_pin_memory = True

# 5. Check if you're using GPU
device_map = "auto"  # Should distribute across available GPUs
```

### Problem 3: Model Not Learning (Loss Not Decreasing)

**Symptoms:**

```
Step 50: Loss = 2.1
Step 100: Loss = 2.1
Step 150: Loss = 2.1
```

**Solutions:**

```python
# 1. Increase learning rate
learning_rate = 5e-4  # Instead of 2e-4

# 2. Increase LoRA rank
r = 32  # Instead of 16

# 3. Check your data format
# Make sure examples are properly formatted

# 4. Increase training steps
num_train_epochs = 5

# 5. Reduce LoRA dropout
lora_dropout = 0.05  # Instead of 0.1
```

### Problem 4: Model Overfitting (Loss Too Low Too Fast)

**Symptoms:**

```
Step 10: Loss = 2.1
Step 20: Loss = 0.3
Step 30: Loss = 0.05
```

**Solutions:**

```python
# 1. Reduce learning rate
learning_rate = 1e-4  # Instead of 2e-4

# 2. Increase dropout
lora_dropout = 0.15  # Instead of 0.05

# 3. Reduce LoRA rank
r = 8  # Instead of 16

# 4. Add more diverse training data

# 5. Use early stopping
# Stop training when loss stops improving
```

### Problem 5: "Permission Denied" or "Model Not Found"

**Symptoms:**

```
HTTPError: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized
```

**Solutions:**

```bash
# 1. Login to HuggingFace
huggingface-cli login

# 2. Accept LLaMA license
# Go to: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
# Click "Agree and access repository"

# 3. Check your internet connection

# 4. Try a different model
# Use "microsoft/DialoGPT-medium" for testing
```

## üìà Monitoring Training Progress

### What to Watch During Training

#### 1. Loss Curve

```python
# Good pattern:
Step 0:   Loss = 2.5
Step 10:  Loss = 2.1  # Decreasing
Step 20:  Loss = 1.8  # Still decreasing
Step 30:  Loss = 1.6  # Steady improvement
Step 40:  Loss = 1.5  # Slowing down (normal)
```

#### 2. GPU Memory Usage

```python
# Check memory usage
nvidia-smi

# Should see:
# - Consistent memory usage (not growing)
# - High GPU utilization (>80%)
# - Temperature under control (<85¬∞C)
```

#### 3. Training Speed

```python
# Look for output like:
# 1.5 it/s (iterations per second)
# 150 tokens/s (tokens per second)

# If too slow:
# - Check GPU utilization
# - Reduce gradient_checkpointing
# - Optimize data loading
```

### üìä Simple Training Monitoring Script

```python
import time
import psutil
import torch

def monitor_training():
    """Simple training monitor"""
    while True:
        # Check GPU memory
        if torch.cuda.is_available():
            memory_used = torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / 1024**3
            memory_total = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory / 1024**3
            print(f"GPU Memory: {memory_used:.1f}GB / {memory_total:.1f}GB")

        # Check CPU and RAM
        cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent()
        ram_percent = psutil.virtual_memory().percent
        print(f"CPU: {cpu_percent}%, RAM: {ram_percent}%")

        time.sleep(30)  # Check every 30 seconds

# Run in a separate terminal while training
# monitor_training()
```

### Tutorial: Building a Recipe Assistant

Let's build a complete recipe assistant from scratch! This will teach you every step of the process.

#### Step 1: Create Your Dataset

```python
# recipe_data.py
import json

recipe_data = [
    {
        "instruction": "How do I make chocolate chip cookies?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Here's how to make delicious chocolate chip cookies:\n\nIngredients:\n- 2¬º cups flour\n- 1 tsp baking soda\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 1 cup butter, softened\n- ¬æ cup brown sugar\n- ¬æ cup white sugar\n- 2 large eggs\n- 2 tsp vanilla\n- 2 cups chocolate chips\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat oven to 375¬∞F\n2. Mix flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl\n3. In another bowl, cream butter and sugars until fluffy\n4. Beat in eggs and vanilla\n5. Gradually mix in flour mixture\n6. Stir in chocolate chips\n7. Drop rounded tablespoons on ungreased baking sheet\n8. Bake 9-11 minutes until golden\n9. Cool on pan for 2 minutes, then transfer to wire rack\n\nTip: Don't overbake - they'll continue cooking on the hot pan!"
    },
    {
        "instruction": "What's the secret to perfect pasta?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "The secrets to perfect pasta:\n\n1. **Use plenty of water**: 4-6 quarts per pound of pasta\n2. **Salt the water generously**: It should taste like seawater\n3. **Don't add oil**: It prevents sauce from sticking\n4. **Stir immediately**: Prevents sticking in first 2 minutes\n5. **Taste test**: Start checking 1-2 minutes before package time\n6. **Save pasta water**: Starchy water helps bind sauce\n7. **Don't rinse**: Unless making pasta salad\n8. **Finish in the sauce**: Toss hot pasta with sauce in the pan\n\nPerfect pasta should be 'al dente' - firm to the bite with no raw flour taste in the center."
    },
    {
        "instruction": "How do I rescue a broken sauce?",

#### Step 2: Prepare the Data for Training

```python
# prepare_recipe_data.py
from llama_lora_data_prep import LlamaDataPreparator

# Initialize the preparator
preparator = LlamaDataPreparator()

# You can test without setting up the tokenizer first
print("Loading recipe data...")

    json.load(open('recipe_data.json'))
)

# Show what the formatted data looks like
print("\\nExample of formatted data:")
print("=" * 50)
print(formatted_data[0]["text"][:500] + "...")

# If you have model access, uncomment these lines:
# preparator.setup_tokenizer()
# dataset = preparator.prepare_training_data(
#     json.load(open('recipe_data.json')),
#     "instruction"

## üß™ Advanced Topics for Continued Learning

### Evaluation and Metrics

#### How to Measure Success

```python
# evaluation.py
def evaluate_model_responses(model, tokenizer, test_questions):
    """Simple evaluation of model responses"""

    results = []
    for question, expected_keywords in test_questions:
        response = ask_question(model, tokenizer, question)

        # Check if expected keywords appear in response
        keyword_score = sum(1 for keyword in expected_keywords
                          if keyword.lower() in response.lower())
        keyword_score = keyword_score / len(expected_keywords)

        # Check response length (should be reasonable)
        length_score = 1.0 if 50 <= len(response.split()) <= 200 else 0.5

        results.append({
            'question': question,
            'response': response,
            'keyword_score': keyword_score,
            'length_score': length_score,
            'overall_score': (keyword_score + length_score) / 2
        })

    return results

# Example test cases
cooking_tests = [
    ("How do I boil eggs?", ["boil", "water", "minutes", "eggs"]),
    ("What temperature for baking cookies?", ["350", "375", "temperature", "oven"]),
    ("How to tell if meat is done?", ["temperature", "thermometer", "internal"])
]

# Run evaluation
# results = evaluate_model_responses(model, tokenizer, cooking_tests)
```

### Handling Different Data Formats

#### From CSV Files

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load CSV data
df = pd.read_csv('cooking_qa.csv')

# Convert to our format
data = []
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    data.append({
        "instruction": row['question'],
        "input": row.get('context', ''),
        "output": row['answer']
    })
```

#### From Existing Datasets

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load a dataset from HuggingFace
dataset = load_dataset("squad", split="train[:1000]")  # First 1000 examples

# Convert to our format
formatted_data = []
for example in dataset:
    formatted_data.append({
        "question": example['question'],
        "context": example['context'],
        "answer": example['answers']['text'][0]
    })
```

### Multi-GPU Training

```python
# For multiple GPUs, modify your training script:
import os
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "0,1,2,3"  # Use GPUs 0-3

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    # ... other args
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=2,
    dataloader_num_workers=4,
    ddp_find_unused_parameters=False,
)
```

### Hyperparameter Tuning

```python
# Try different configurations
configs = [
    {"r": 8, "alpha": 16, "lr": 1e-4},
    {"r": 16, "alpha": 32, "lr": 2e-4},
    {"r": 32, "alpha": 64, "lr": 2e-4},
]

for config in configs:
    print(f"Testing config: {config}")
    # Train with this configuration
    # Evaluate results
    # Keep track of best performing config
```

## üåü Advanced Configuration

### Validation During Training

```python
# Split your dataset for validation
from datasets import Dataset

def split_dataset(data, test_size=0.1):
    """Split data into training and validation sets"""
    split_idx = int(len(data) * (1 - test_size))
    train_data = data[:split_idx]
    val_data = data[split_idx:]
    return train_data, val_data

# In your training script:
train_data, val_data = split_dataset(your_data)

train_dataset = preparator.prepare_training_data(train_data, "instruction")
val_dataset = preparator.prepare_training_data(val_data, "instruction")

# Add validation to trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=peft_model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=val_dataset,  # Add this line
    data_collator=data_collator,
)

# Training arguments with validation
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    # ... other args
    evaluation_strategy="steps",     # Evaluate during training
    eval_steps=50,                  # Evaluate every 50 steps
    load_best_model_at_end=True,    # Load best model when done
    metric_for_best_model="eval_loss",  # Use validation loss
    greater_is_better=False,        # Lower loss is better
)
```

### Custom Loss Functions

```python
# For advanced users: custom loss functions
from torch.nn import CrossEntropyLoss

class WeightedCrossEntropyLoss:
    def __init__(self, ignore_index=-100):
        self.ignore_index = ignore_index
        self.loss_fn = CrossEntropyLoss(ignore_index=ignore_index)

    def __call__(self, logits, labels):
        # Apply custom weighting logic here
        return self.loss_fn(logits.view(-1, logits.size(-1)), labels.view(-1))
```

## üöÄ Deployment and Production

### Saving and Loading Models

```python
# Save your LoRA adapter
model.save_pretrained("my_cooking_assistant")

# Load in production
from peft import PeftModel
base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct")
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "my_cooking_assistant")
```

### Creating a Simple API

```python
# simple_api.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
from peft import PeftModel

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load model once at startup
model = None
tokenizer = None

def load_model():
    global model, tokenizer
    base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
        "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
        device_map="auto"
    )
    model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "my_cooking_assistant")
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct")

@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def ask_question():
    data = request.json
    question = data.get('question', '')

    # Generate response (reuse your existing function)
    response = ask_recipe_question(model, tokenizer, question)

    return jsonify({'answer': response})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    load_model()
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

# Test with: curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question":"How do I make pasta?"}' http://localhost:5000/ask
```

### Model Optimization for Production

```python
# Optimize for inference speed
model.half()  # Use 16-bit precision
model.eval()  # Set to evaluation mode

# For faster inference
with torch.no_grad():
    # All your inference code here
    pass
```

## üìö Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How much data do I need?

**A:** You can start with as few as 10-20 high-quality examples! For most tasks:

- **Minimum**: 10-50 examples for basic adaptation
- **Good**: 100-500 examples for solid performance
- **Excellent**: 1000+ examples for production-quality results

### Q: How long does training take?

**A:** Depends on your setup:

- **16GB GPU**: 2-4 hours for 100 examples
- **24GB GPU**: 1-2 hours for 100 examples
- **40GB+ GPU**: 30-60 minutes for 100 examples

### Q: Can I use CPU only?

**A:** While possible, it's extremely slow (days instead of hours). Better options:

- Use Google Colab (free GPU)
- Try Kaggle notebooks (free GPU)
- Use cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### Q: How do I know if my model is working?

**A:** Test it! Ask questions similar to your training data:

- Compare responses before/after training
- Check if it uses domain-specific terminology
- Evaluate response quality and relevance

### Q: My model gives weird responses. What's wrong?

**A:** Common issues:

- **Data formatting**: Check your prompt format
- **Overfitting**: Reduce LoRA rank or add more data
- **Learning rate**: Try lower learning rate (1e-4)
- **Training time**: You might need more epochs

### Q: Can I fine-tune for multiple tasks?

**A:** Yes! Create a mixed dataset:

```json
[
  { "instruction": "Translate to Spanish", "input": "Hello", "output": "Hola" },
  {
    "instruction": "Summarize this text",
    "input": "Long text...",
    "output": "Summary..."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Answer this question",
    "input": "What is...?",
    "output": "Answer..."
  }
]
```

### Q: How do I avoid overfitting?

**A:** Several strategies:

- Use validation data to monitor performance
- Increase LoRA dropout (0.1-0.2)
- Reduce LoRA rank if you have small dataset
- Add more diverse training examples
- Stop training when validation loss stops improving

### Q: Can I combine multiple LoRA adapters?

**A:** Yes! Advanced technique:

```python
# Load multiple adapters
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "cooking_adapter")
model.load_adapter("coding_adapter", "coding")
model.load_adapter("writing_adapter", "writing")

# Switch between adapters
model.set_adapter("cooking")  # For cooking questions
model.set_adapter("coding")   # For coding questions
```
